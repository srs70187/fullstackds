# Tomorrow's Data Scientist
Resources and short modules for learning the modern data scientist's toolbox. Will cover the following topics, each with use cases for a data scientist in mind:

- Operating Systems and IaaS
    - Overview
        - Windows: 
            - Command Line Overview: one step lower level than the GUI
                - executing programs, batch scripting, scheduling jobs with the windows scheduler, default text encoding
            - Environment variables are your best friend
            - Folder Structure and file types
        - Linux:
            - What is Linux? 
                - bash
                - what does open source actually mean?
            - Linux Essentials:
                - bash commands
                - folder structure
                - environment variables
                - package managers 
                - bash scripting
                - scheduling cron jobs
                - UTF-8 encoding and file types
        - Windows & Linux - When it makes sense to use one or the other
            - Runtime threading and cores, RAM considerations
            - Single vs. Multithreading
            - Deployment & Automation
    - **Cloud Services**

    - IaaS Project: GitHub Pages - show how easy it is to create and host a website using github pages. we will build on this later with python notebooks and r markdown files, but this will put everything we learned into practical use and set us up to talk about Cloud Services and Programming Languages.
            - Hacking together a webpage with Jekyll
            - What is actually happening here?


- Reproducibility


- Ultimately we would like our analyses to be consumable by as many people as possible.

    - Language of the web - mostly terminology and brief overview. As data scientists we will usually interact with web frameworks through simpler API's and languages such as Markdown, YAML, Jekyll, iPython notebook, etc.
        - HTML
        - CSS, etc.
        - JavaScript - server-side vs. client-side; front-end vs. back-end
        - Developer Tools in Chrome
        - Very High level: How Does a modern application work?


- Ultimately we do not want to worry about whether we're working on the most updated version of our project. 
        - Git via GitHub and BitBucket
            - Go deep into git and why it is essential to use for personal development and for collaborative development
            - How to use github's website as your search engine for ideas and projects, and as a plug into any space you're interested in. 
                - **Building an automated feed to monitor github trends will be the first project**
        - Dropbox/OneDrive/Sharepoint - when to use and not to use

- Ultimately we do not want to have to worry about what types of systems our programs will work on. 

    - Microservices and Conatiners 
        - Development using Docker
        - PaaS to deploy microservices, automating some of the Iaas steps we've learned

- Programming Languages

- Cloud Services - IaaS
- Cloud Services - PaaS
- Cloud Services - Databases
- Resources - places to look when you don't know the answer, cost-benefit analysis of spending time to search for the right answer, how to sift through information as you're doing your research on the answer you need
